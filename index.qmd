## Analyses

### Age of the participants

We visualize how the age of the participants changed between editions using the package [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) [@wickham2016]. To do so, we estimated the mean and the standard deviation per edition. Note that the persian mathematician and astronomer Al Biruni was one of the first to use a concept close to the arithmetic mean to correct astronomical observations [@al-birun2024], and he was really proud of this (@fig-al-biruni).

We plot the mean ± standard-deviation of participants age according to the edition (@fig-age, @fig-age-percent).

### Origin of the participants

We visualize how the origin of the participants changed between editions (@fig-regions).
